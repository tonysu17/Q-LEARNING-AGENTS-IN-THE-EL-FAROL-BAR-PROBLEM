# Q-LEARNING-AGENTS-IN-THE-EL-FAROL-BAR-PROBLEM
Agent-based simulation of the El Farol Bar Problem using Q-learning. This dissertation investigates how reinforcement learning agents achieve efficient and equitable coordination, reproducing Arthur 1994's dynamics. We analysed the impact of agent memory, exploration, and learning rate on attendance volatility, efficiency, and equity.
